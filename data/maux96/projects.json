        "description": "This project focuses on the design and implementation of a distributed file transfer protocol (FTP) system using Python, with a particular emphasis on leader coordination through the Bully algorithm. Distributed systems present unique challenges in terms of synchronization and coordination, especially regarding the election of a leader to manage critical operations. The Bully algorithm, recognized for its effectiveness in selecting leaders in distributed networks, plays a crucial role in this project. Distributed FTP Implementation: A distributed FTP system is developed that allows secure file transfers between nodes in a network. This system is designed to be resilient and scalable, capable of handling multiple simultaneous transfer requests without compromising performance. Bully Algorithm for Leader Coordination: The Bully algorithm is integrated for the election of leaders among the system nodes. This algorithm ensures that there is always an active and available node to coordinate FTP operations, even in case of failures or disconnections of some nodes. Failure Management and Reconnections: The system includes mechanisms to detect and handle node failures, ensuring the continuity of FTP service. When a node fails, the Bully algorithm activates a selection process to designate a new leader, minimizing service interruption."
