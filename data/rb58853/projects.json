        "description": "The classification of music genres plays a crucial role in modern digital audio signal processing applications. In this study, we propose several machine learning approaches to accurately categorize music tracks into predefined genres. Each approach uses different sets of 'features' that can be extracted from songs; ranging from common ones like MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) and direct audio signals to less explored 'features' in this context such as song lyrics and Wavelet Transform. To evaluate the models, we use the GTZAN reference dataset in the field. The results obtained highlight that song lyrics do not contribute much to classification, at least in the dataset used. The other models show results consistent with the state of the art, with an accuracy between 0.75 and 0.80.",

The strategies employed include the use of vector models, latent semantic analysis (LSA), Vaswani attention, and the implementation of Trie structures for indexing and grouping documents.Vector Models and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA): A vector-based approach is adopted to represent documents and queries in a multidimensional space, allowing similarities to be calculated through distance or cosine measures. LSA is applied to extract semantic 'features', improving contextual understanding and overcoming challenges such as synonymy and polysemy. Vaswani Attention: By incorporating Vaswani attention, complex relationships between words are captured, enhancing accuracy by considering the broader context in information retrieval.Trie Structure: A Trie structure is implemented to index and group documents, facilitating quick and effective searches. This enables near-instantaneous retrieval of relevant documents based on specific search patterns. This system not only demonstrates the ability to combine various techniques and algorithms to address complex challenges in processing and analyzing large volumes of data but also results in a robust and scalable system."

        "description": "An agent is understood as an entity capable of perceiving its environment, processing such perceptions, and responding to them with an action in its environment. A navigation agent, in turn, is an entity that can also navigate (move) within a given space. The simplest example of a navigation space would be a matrix of positions where an entity moves under certain rules or valid movements; the agent must be able to move from one position to another in this space. In this project, we define the navigation space as a mesh of traversable polygons that connect through edges, specifically a mesh of triangles. A multi-agent system is a system composed of multiple agents that interact with each other and have the capacity to communicate with each other. Among the main characteristics of an agent, it is important to highlight its autonomous behavior, its local vision of the system, and its decentralization, meaning that there is no entity that controls the global behavior of all agents. These multi-agent systems have been used in computing for years for crowd simulation, some of their utilities include simulating people in certain circumstances such as in an evacuation, a bus terminal, etc. In recent years, multi-agent systems have been used in the simulation of cinematic crowds, as is the case with The Lord of the Rings. Specifically, in our project, we will deal with this multi-agent system and the navigation system of the same, oriented towards the world of video games.",

Blue is known for its tile placement mechanics and scoring based on patterns and sequences. In this simulation, the fundamental rules of the game are modeled, including the arrangement of tiles, color selection, and point calculation according to player configurations. Declarative programming in Prolog allows for clear and concise definition of the game rules and victory conditions, leveraging automatic inference and Prolog's capability to find solutions from predefined facts and rules. The project includes:Rule Definition: The rules of the Blue game are established in terms of facts and logical rules in Prolog, enabling a direct interpretation of the game mechanics. Turn Simulation: Logic is implemented to simulate game turns, where each player can select tiles from virtual factories and place them on their personal boards following the game's restrictions. Point Calculation: A module is developed to automatically calculate each player's points at the end of each round and at the end of the game, based on the positions of the tiles on their boards. User Interface: Although Prolog is not known for its graphical capabilities, a simple text interface is created that allows users to interact with the simulation, select actions, and view the current state of the game."

Distributed systems present unique challenges in terms of synchronization and coordination, especially regarding the election of a leader to manage critical operations. The Bully algorithm, recognized for its effectiveness in selecting leaders in distributed networks, plays a crucial role in this project. Distributed FTP Implementation: A distributed FTP system is developed that allows secure file transfers between nodes in a network. This system is designed to be resilient and scalable, capable of handling multiple simultaneous transfer requests without compromising performance. Bully Algorithm for Leader Coordination: The Bully algorithm is integrated for the election of leaders among the system nodes. This algorithm ensures that there is always an active and available node to coordinate FTP operations, even in case of failures or disconnections of some nodes. Failure Management and Reconnections: The system includes mechanisms to detect and handle node failures, ensuring the continuity of FTP service. When a node fails, the Bully algorithm activates a selection process to designate a new leader, minimizing service interruption."
