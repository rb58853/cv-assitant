The work employs a new approach: the application of the Segment Anything (SAM) segmentation models and the Constractive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model for the generation of multimodal embeddings. Special emphasis is placed on image retrieval via precise queries, taking into account the position of image segments that compose the same, processing both text and images. This thesis project focuses on retrieving images using text as input. During indexing, embeddings of the image and its segmentations are created to achieve retrieval based on positional information. The Meta SAM (Segment Anything Model) is used to segment the images, and each segmentation generates a multimodal embedding using the OpenAI CLIP model, which generates embeddings for both images and text. Using all generated embeddings, both for images and the original image segmentation, retrieval is performed by matching text against images.",
